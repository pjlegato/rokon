The objective of this major update is to change the way texture's are handled.

Classes:
	Texture - representative of each individual small image, is not affected by map or hardware
	TextureAlas - a collection of Texture's, mapped onto a larger atlas. This may be predefined by the 'atlas.exe' tool
	HardwareTexture - interfaces between a TextureAtlas and the hardware, loads, removes, sets texture options
	TextureManager - contains all the texture objects, this will hold queue's for loading/removes/changing as needed
